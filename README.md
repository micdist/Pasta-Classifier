## Pasta length classifier

Were you missing a tool that matched your need for classification with your love for pasta?

This humble, ML powered (```ResNet-18, fastAI```) and useless app aims to help with that,
telling if you are dealing with short pasta or long pasta.

Whether you are just courious or want to navigate italian dishes by the size of our favourite carbs, give this thing a try.


### **Caveat Emptor**<br />
This may classify your pup as "corta" or "lunga".<br />
Pasta may contain gluten.<br />
Composition of pasta is not relevant.<br />
Should work with both cooked and raw pasta (packed or not).<br />
Results may vary.<br />
Results may be inconsistent or incorrect.<br />
In case of inconsistent or incorrect results relax and measure the pasta yourself, this app is just an exercise for the brilliant FastAi course.<br /><br />
